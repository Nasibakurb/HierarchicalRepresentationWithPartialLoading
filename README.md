# HierarchicalRepresentationWithPartialLoading
Using .NET MVC web programming technology, the Visual Studio platform and the C# programming language, you need to create the ability to display, add, edit and delete data from one hierarchical table. The hierarchical table has the following fields: ID, NAME, PARENTID. ID – record identifier. NAME – record name. PARENTID – identifier of the parent record. The presence of a parent record identifier allows you to build a hierarchical view of the data, when at the beginning the root elements of the hierarchy are displayed, for which PARENTID = NULL, and then when you click on the corresponding “+” located with the list element, we get access to its child elements. Each list element, in addition to the ability to hide and reveal child elements, should have the ability to edit the element, add a new child element, and delete the element. And when you click on the edit or add button, a modal window appears with a form where you fill in the name of the element and a link to its parent. Initially, all elements of the hierarchical table are not loaded onto the page, but only the root ones. Child elements are loaded onto the page only when they are first expanded, if they have not been loaded before, otherwise, a previously hidden area of the page is simply displayed.
